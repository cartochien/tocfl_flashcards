# TOCFL Flashcard Web App   
This is a personal project I have been working on to help me study Chinese based on the TOCFL (Test of Chinese as a Foreign Language) word lists. It originally started out as a humble text program that would run in the Python Shell and has since evolved into a web app that runs on Flask. The app accepts both normal pinyin and numeric pinyin as valid inputs.

## Installation
In your command prompt, do the following:  
```
> git clone https://github.com/cartochien/tocfl_flashcards  
> cd tocfl_flashcards 
> pip install -r requirements.txt 
> run app.py
```  

Once you're running ```app.py```, go to ```http://127.0.0.1:5000/``` on your web browser and use the app!
